# Task 1 SSH Commit Signature Verification

1. **Brief summary explaining the benefits of signing commits.**
    Commits can be signed using GPG, SSH, or S/MIME. The main goal for signing commits is verification of authenticity. This ensures that commits were actually made by the claimed author, preventing impersonation. 

    Also signing commits helps with:
   - Tamper Protection – Confirms that the commit content hasn’t been altered after signing. 
   - Trust & Integrity – Helps teams verify the legitimacy of changes, especially in open-source or collaborative projects. 
   - Compliance – Meets security requirements for organizations that mandate signed commits.
